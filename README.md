# 3d-view-using-real-images

The main aim of this project is the reconstrution of an object in a 3D view. The project used two calbrated cameras attached as a robotic eye from which the images of left and right perspective is taken and then recontruct the view in a 3D space using PointCloud library and opencv techniques.
